The Programming Systems Group at the University of Kansas is dedicated to advancing the field of programming languages with the goal of empowering programmers to build reliable, efficient, and maintainable software systems with ease. We use programming language abstractions to design languages, type systems, program analysis, and synthesis techniques to design practical tools towards this goal.

> **I am hiring Ph.D. students for our group!** [Here are some reasons](/why-ku) why our group and KU might be a great fit. Please [send me an email](mailto:sankha@ku.edu) and apply to the [graduate program in EECS](https://eecs.ku.edu/graduate-programs) at KU if you want to join us. If you are already at KU, shoot me an email to set up a meeting.
